"""dSpark: DeepSeek-V4-Flash's semi-autoregressive draft model.

DSV4-Flash ships a drafter under ``mtp.{0..n_mtp_layers-1}`` in the checkpoint. It is
NOT a one-token-per-step MTP head: it proposes a whole BLOCK of ``dspark_block_size``
tokens per draft pass, scores them with a low-rank Markov transition head, and gates
acceptance with a confidence head. That block structure is what makes it worth having
on an offload MoE -- one pass over the experts yields five candidate tokens instead of
one, and expert traffic is what bounds decode here.

Shape of a draft pass:

1. The target hands over its hidden state at ``dspark_target_layer_ids`` (40, 41, 42),
   concatenated. ``main_norm(main_proj(...))`` projects that back to one hidden width.
2. Each draft layer derives its CONTEXT KV from that same projected tensor, through its
   own ``wkv``/``kv_norm``, and writes it at the context slots -- the drafter never runs
   the prompt itself.
3. The block's tokens run through ``n_mtp_layers`` full DSV4 blocks (MLA attention,
   routed FP4 experts, hyper-connections), then ``hc_head`` and ``norm``.
4. ``markov_head`` adds a transition bias keyed on the previously sampled token, and
   ``confidence_head`` scores how likely each position is to survive verification.

Draft layers carry no compressor and no Lightning Indexer -- the checkpoint has no such
weights for them -- so they attend over the sliding window only. Their layer ids
continue the target's (``n_layers + k``), which is what lets the expert banks, the GPU
slot cache and the KV pools address draft and target layers with one index space.
